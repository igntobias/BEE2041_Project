# BEE2041_Project
Final project of the Term

This project is a data processing assignment where webscraping will be used to obtain data from the internet. At this stage, I will try to gather information of interest (at the moment it may not necessarily be academic or economic in nature) and play around with the data.

The structure of the repository is simple, a readme file, any potential datafiles/zip files that (may) be used or downloaded for this project, as well as the ipynb/jupyter notebook file meant to emulate the blog.
