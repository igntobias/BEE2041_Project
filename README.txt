# BEE2041_Project
Final project of the Term

This project is a data processing assignment where webscraping will be used to obtain data from the internet. At this stage, I will try to gather information of interest (at the moment it may not necessarily be academic or economic in nature) and play around with the data.
The structure of the repository is simple, a readme file, any potential datafiles/zip files that (may) be used or downloaded for this project, as well as the ipynb/jupyter notebook file meant to emulate the blog. 

The topic of this project is to scrape data about the video game, Genshin Impact. The game is a "gacha game," wherein characters are obtained through a loot crate system. Multiple copies of the character will make the character stronger.
A maximum of 6 extra copies of a character are obtainable and each "constellation" will provide the character with new buffs, abilities, or in-game stats. Thus, The aim of this research is to try and scrape data from public fan sites and analyse the descriptions.
The code will be scraping from a total of two websites, one to obtain release dates and one to obtain the character names, IDs, and constellation descriptions.

To the best of my knoweldge, these two sites do not have any ToS that prohibits web scraping. If this changes, then these sites have updated their terms of service or other changes have occured since the creation of this project.
